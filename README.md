User Services
=============

Generic cloud database services to be called for building applications

Running
-------

install `mongodb`, `node.js`, `npm`, `express`. Now change to the `user` directory and run: `$ npm install -d`. Starting up is as simple as: `$ node app.js`

NOTE: the node.js server is configured to listen on localhost:3100. It also assumes a mongodb running on localhost:27017. Both these settings can be changed in `app.js`
